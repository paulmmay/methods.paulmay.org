description: The think aloud protocol is used in usability testing. Quite simply, as you're asking a person ("the tester") to use a product (a prototype, a website, a piece of software) you ask them to think aloud so that you understand what they're doing, why they're doing it, what problems or frustrations they experience. This method tells you how to introduce the think aloud protocol to the tester.

### Equipment
* A <a href="/methods/test-plan">test plan</a> listing the tasks you'd like the tester to attempt.
* An audio recorder or video camera.
* Access to the prototype/site/package being tested testing.
* Screen capture [software](http://silverbackapp.com/) (optional, but recommended).

### Method
* Welcome and thank the participant and introduce yourself.
* Tell the tester that *they* are not being tested. The product's quality is being tested.
* Reassure the tester that it's okay if they experience difficulties. 
* Tell the tester that an [audio, video] recording will be made of the test.
* Ask the tester to sign a <a href="/methods/usability-test-waiver">waiver</a>.  
* Ask the tester if she has any questions.
* Start recording.
* Introduce the first task.

First, some background. Throughout BMT treatment, patients and their caregivers are expected to absorb a lot of new information. Because the procedure is shifting toward homebound transplants, caregivers have a higher burden because they are responsible for the patient’s well being 24/7. Patients need to be well educated about the transplant and various side effects and of the overall changes in their body and life style. We’re building a new educational tool to make information about BMT more straightforward and appropriate to each patient and their caregiver.
We’ve built a simple version of a new site and we want to get feedback from you. We’ll ask you to use the site to carry out a few different tasks.
We are not testing you; this is not a test of your ability to use the site. We’re testing the site – how well it works for you. 

As you go through the tasks I’d like you to talk aloud. Just tell me what you’re thinking as you go along. 
You can be completely open and honest, don’t be afraid to say that something is confusing or doesn’t work for you – we really need that feedback. 
As you go through the tasks you can ask me questions, but I may not be able to help you. We want to see you go through the tasks without help.
We’re going to record what happens on the screen as you navigate through the interface, and we’ll make an audio recording of the things you say. These recordings will only be seen and heard by the people working on the site. After we are done we’ll take what we have learned from you to make improvements to the site.


### Script (Better to mingle this in with the method)
> Hello, my name is Paul. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us test our product.
> So, before I begin I just want to explain a few things. 


* Tell the tester that as they go through the test they can ask questions, but that you may not be able to help.
