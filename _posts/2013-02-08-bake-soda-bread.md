### Equipment
* Weighing scales or measuring cups
* Large mixing bowl
* Large spoon or spatula
* 1lb loaf tin or a flat baking tray

### Ingredients
* 450g (16oz, approx 3.5 cups) plain flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
*  tsp salt
* 350ml (12fl oz) buttermilk

### Method
* Pre-heat the oven thoroughly to 230&deg;C (450&deg;F).
* Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
* Mix in most of the buttermilk (about 300ml or 10fl oz).
* The dough should come together as a compact, matte ball. If the dough is still crumbly after a couple of minutes of mixing, gradually add in some more of the buttermilk. 
* Tip the ball of dough into the tin and push it down a little.
* If you're using a baking tray, place the ball of dough onto it and push it down a little, just to make it a bit more squat.
* Cut a cross or pattern in the top of the dough.
* Bake for 45 minutes or thereabouts. The bread should sound hollow when you knock on its base.
* Leave to cool
