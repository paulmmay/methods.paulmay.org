description: When a product is "usable" it helps a person to do something with as little fuss or frustration as possible. One way to check that a product is usable is to observe a person as they use the product while describing what they're doing and why - thinking aloud. After the test you can then make changes to your product to iron out anything that caused problems for the tester. This is a usability test. In this method I describe the steps that I go through to get a usability test off to a good start. In <a href="/usability-moderation">another method</a> I describe my approach to moderating a usability test.

### Equipment
* A <a href="/test-plan">test plan</a> that gives background information about the test.
* A <a href="/test-script">test script</a> listing the tasks you'd like the tester to perform	.
* Screen capture software. <span class="super">1</span>
* A video camera and microphone. <span class="super">2</span>
* An audio recorder. <span class="super">3</span>
* The prototype/site/package being tested.
* Chilled water for the tester to drink, a glass.
* A gift or payment to thank the tester for their time.

### Steps
* Welcome the tester and introduce yourself.
>Hi Jane, my name is Paul.
* Thank the tester for her time.
>Thank you for agreeing to help us today. 
* Give the tester their gift or payment. <span class="super">4</span>
>Before we begin I'd like to give you this small token to thank you for coming in today. 
* Briefly describe the product that is being tested. <span class="super">5</span>
>Let me just tell you what we're doing. We're building a travel website and we have asked you and a few other people to try out the site so that we can spot any problems before the site goes live.
* Explain the flow of the test.
>In a couple of minutes I'll bring the site up on the computer. I'll ask you to try doing a few things. When you get to the end of each task I'll ask you a couple of questions, then we'll move on to the next task. Does that make sense?
* Explain the think-aloud protocol.
>This might sound a bit strange, but as you use the site I want you to just think out loud. Tell me what you're doing and why. Tell me if something doesn't seem to make sense. Just say whatever is on your mind as you use the site. I might ask you a few questions if I don't understand something. 
* Explain that the product's quality is being tested. Reassure the tester that *they* are not being tested and that it's okay if they experience difficulties. 
>Now, I want to assure you that *you* are not being tested. If something doesn't work or doesn't feel right, that's not a reflection on you - that's something we can improve upon. The site is being tested, not you.
* Tell them what to do if they have questions.<span class="super">6</span>
>If you have questions as we go through the test you can ask me, but I may not be able to answer. I would like for you to use the site with as little guidance from me as possible.
* Tell the tester that a recording will be made of the test.
>I'm going to make video and audio recordings of the test, I'll also take some handwritten notes. A program on the computer will record the screen so that we can see where you move the mouse. The camera on the desk will record your face and the sound of your voice. This little audio recorder is a backup. Do you have any questions about the recordings?
* Ask the tester to sign a waiver that gives you permission to use the recordings made during the test.  
>Now I need you to sign this waiver that says that it's okay for us to make the recordings and use them afterwards. There are two copies. Sign both copies and keep one for your records.
* Ask the tester if she has any questions.
>Now, do you have any questions before we get started?
* Offer the tester some water.
>There's a glass of water next to you on the desk. I can get more if you need it. Just ask.
* Start recording.
>I'm going to start recording now.
* Introduce the first task as per the test script.
>Okay, first what I'd like you to do is...

#### Notes
1. If you are testing something on a standard computer monitor I really recommend that you use screen recording software like <a href="http://silverbackapp.com">Silverback</a>. Silverback will record what is happening on the screen. It will also record audio from the computer's microphone, video from a built-in camera or a camera attached via a USB port. It will export all of this to a single video file. 
2. Using a video camera is a good idea when you're testing paper prototypes, applications on mobile devices, or anything physical/tactile. You'll mount the camera on a tripod or <a href="http://www.mrtappy.com/">mount</a> so that you can see the product and what the person is doing, and ideally also their voice. 
3. I use it an inexpensive audio recorded (an Olympus VN-8100PC) as a backup during usability tests. It's also what I use when I do research interviews.
4. Participants usually know that there is some kind of gift or payment associated with the test. If they know that there is a reward then give it to them *before* starting the test to avoid the perception that the payment/gift is a contingent on them being positive about the product being tested. My thinking that once the person already has the envelope in their pocket they're more likely to give frank answers. If they do not know that there is a gift/payment then I will do this after the test.
5. Keep this brief, factual and as objective as possible. If you use overtly enthusiastic language you will prime the tester to hold back negative feedback. Just give the tester enough information to get them started.
6. It's best if the tester persists with the task with as little guidance as possible. Avoid answering questions that help the tester complete the task.
