<h2>Introducing the Think Aloud Protocol</h2>
<div id="method-meta">
<p class="method-updated">11 January 2013</p></div>
<p class="method-description">The think aloud protocol is used in usability testing. Quite simply, as you're asking a person ("the tester") to use a product (a prototype, a website, a piece of software) you ask them to think aloud so that you understand what they're doing, why they're doing it, what problems or frustrations they experience. This method tells you how to introduce the think aloud protocol to the tester.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="/test-plan">test plan</a> that gives background information about the test.</li>
<li>A <a href="/test-script">test script</a> listing the tasks you'd like the tester to perform   .</li>
<li>Screen capture software <span class="super">1</span>.</li>
<li>A video camera and/or audio recorder <span class="super">2</span>.</li>
<li>Access to the prototype/site/package being tested testing.</li>
<li>Chilled water for the tester to drink, a glass.</li>
<li>A gift or payment to thank the tester for their time.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Method</h3>

<ul>
<li>Welcome and thank the participant and introduce yourself.</li>
<li>Give the tester their gift or payment and thank them for their time <span class="super">3</span>.</li>
<li>Briefly describe the product that is being tested<span class="super">1</span>.</li>
<li>Explain that the product's quality is being tested.</li>
<li>Reassure the tester that <em>they</em> are not being tested.</li>
<li>Reassure the tester that it's okay if they experience difficulties.</li>
<li>Tell them what to do if they have questions.<span class="super">2</span></li>
<li>Tell the tester that a recording will be made of the test.</li>
<li>Ask the tester to sign a <a href="/methods/usability-test-waiver">waiver</a>.</li>
<li>Ask the tester if she has any questions.</li>
<li>Start recording.</li>
<li>Introduce the first task as per the test plan.</li>
</ul>

First, some background. Throughout BMT treatment, patients and their caregivers are expected to absorb a lot of new information. Because the procedure is shifting toward homebound transplants, caregivers have a higher burden because they are responsible for the patient’s well being 24/7. Patients need to be well educated about the transplant and various side effects and of the overall changes in their body and life style. We’re building a new educational tool to make information about BMT more straightforward and appropriate to each patient and their caregiver.
We’ve built a simple version of a new site and we want to get feedback from you. We’ll ask you to use the site to carry out a few different tasks.
We are not testing you; this is not a test of your ability to use the site. We’re testing the site – how well it works for you. 

As you go through the tasks I’d like you to talk aloud. Just tell me what you’re thinking as you go along. 
You can be completely open and honest, don’t be afraid to say that something is confusing or doesn’t work for you – we really need that feedback. 
As you go through the tasks you can ask me questions, but I may not be able to help you. We want to see you go through the tasks without help.
We’re going to record what happens on the screen as you navigate through the interface, and we’ll make an audio recording of the things you say. These recordings will only be seen and heard by the people working on the site. After we are done we’ll take what we have learned from you to make improvements to the site.


### Script (Better to mingle this in with the method)
> Hello, my name is Paul. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us test our product.
> So, before I begin I just want to explain a few things.

<ol>
<li>If you are testing something on a standard computer monitor I really recommend that you use screen recording software like <a href="http://silverbackapp.com">Silverback</a> as well as a video camera as a backup. Screen recording software shows the movement of the mouse pointer, form input and other on-screen features in detail that a camera won't be able to match.</li>
<li>I have been using the same Olympus VN-8100PC digital voice recorder for years. I use it as a backup to the video camera and screen recording software during usability testing, and when I'm recording research interviews. It works for me. Using a video camera is a good idea when you're testing paper prototypes, applications on mobile devices, or anything physical/tactile.</li>
<li>I do this <em>before</em> starting the test to avoid the perception that the payment/gift is a contingent on them being positive about the product being tested. My thinking that once the person already has the envelope in their pocket they're more likely to give frank answers.</li>
<li>Keep this brief, factual and as objective as possible. "We're asked you here today to use a new travel website. The site allows you to compare flight prices from a number of airlines" rather than "We're excited to let you try our groundbreaking new service that helps people like you save money by making the process of comparing flight prices insanely easy - it's just amazing". Straying into enthusiastic language will prime the tester to hold back negative feedback and will make you look unprofessional.</li>
<li>Once you've described the task to the tester, it's best if they persists with the task with as little guidance as possible. Usually it's best to tell the tester that it's okay to ask questions, but that you might not be able to answer. Avoid answering questions that help the tester complete the task.</li>
</ol>
