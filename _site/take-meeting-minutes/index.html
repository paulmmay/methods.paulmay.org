<h2>Take Meeting Minutes</h2>
<div id="method-meta">
<p class="method-updated">18 January 2013</p></div>
<p class="method-description">A meeting is a gathering of people to make decisions, answer crisp, well-defined questions and decide on future actions.<span class="super">1</span> Meetings are expensive since they occupy a number of people's time to the exclusion of all other matters. They should only be held when absolutely necessary. When they are held they should be brief. The meeting's minutes will be the official record of what decisions are made, what questions are answered and what actions are to be taken next. Without the minutes there is no foundation for further action. In this method I describe the steps involved in taking meeting minutes.</p>
<h3>Before the Meeting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get and read the meeting's agenda.<span class="super">1</span></li>
<li>Understand the relationships between the people on the agenda.

<blockquote><p>Paul and Jim manage the company's facilities. John owns the company.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Know who the key decision maker is.

<blockquote><p>John is the key decision maker.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Make sure you have a notebook and pen.</li>
<li>Arrive at the meeting a few minutes early.</li>
</ul>


<h3>During the Meeting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Note the date, time and location.</li>
<li>Write down the names of people who are in attendance.</li>
<li>Write down the names of anyone who was invited but who is not in attendance.</li>
<li>Write down the item being discussed.

<blockquote><p>Decision 1: Should we move all staff into building A or building B?</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Write down key points of any discussion.

<blockquote><p>Paul: Building A has more space, poorer facilities.
Jim: More space is the key reason for the move. Facilities can be improved over time.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Take note of decisions made

<blockquote><p>It was decided that the company would move all staff to building A. Consensus.<span class="super">3</span></p></blockquote></li>
<li>Take a note of any actions that need to be taken as a result of the decision:

<blockquote><p>Action: Paul to sign the lease on building A on Monday.
Action: John to tell staff that building A has been chosen.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>If anything is not clear or not specific enough you should clarify with the people at the meeting and note the outcome:

<blockquote><p>When is John going to tell the staff and how?
Decision: John will tell staff about the move on Thursday between 1pm and 2pm.</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<h3>After the Meeting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Type up your hand-written notes.</li>
<li>Use the meeting's original agenda as a structure for the minutes. Under each item in the agenda</li>
<li>Send the minutes to the people who were on the original agenda.</li>
<li>Ask the people who were in attendance to check that the minutes are complete (everything that was discussed is in the minutes) and accurate (everything in the minutes is true).</li>
<li>Ask the people who were in attendance to send any corrections to the minutes by a particular date and time.

<blockquote><p>If anything in the minutes is incorrect please send a correction by tomorrow at 1pm.</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>Decisions to be made and questions to be answered are identified in advance of the meeting and included in the meeting's agenda. The agenda will also list the people attending the meeting, its date, time, and location.</li>
<li>The agenda will probably not explicitly state who the key decision maker is, but you should find out. If a consensus isn't reached on a particular item then the decision maker</li>
<li>The alternative to a decision made by consensus is one made by the key decision maker. In this case you'd note that a decision couldn't be arrived at by consensus and then note the decision made at by the key decision maker.</li>
</ol>
