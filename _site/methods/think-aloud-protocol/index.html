<h2>Introduce the Think Aloud Protocol</h2>
<p>Welcome and thank the participant, introduce yourself.So, before I begin I just want to explain a few things. First, some background. Throughout BMT treatment, patients and their caregivers are expected to absorb a lot of new information. Because the procedure is shifting toward homebound transplants, caregivers have a higher burden because they are responsible for the patient’s well being 24/7. Patients need to be well educated about the transplant and various side effects and of the overall changes in their body and life style. We’re building a new educational tool to make information about BMT more straightforward and appropriate to each patient and their caregiver.We’ve built a simple version of a new site and we want to get feedback from you. We’ll ask you to use the site to carry out a few different tasks.We are not testing you; this is not a test of your ability to use the site. We’re testing the site – how well it works for you. As you go through the tasks I’d like you to talk aloud. Just tell me what you’re thinking as you go along. You can be completely open and honest, don’t be afraid to say that something is confusing or doesn’t work for you – we really need that feedback. As you go through the tasks you can ask me questions, but I may not be able to help you. We want to see you go through the tasks without help.We’re going to record what happens on the screen as you navigate through the interface, and we’ll make an audio recording of the things you say. These recordings will only be seen and heard by the people working on the site. After we are done we’ll take what we have learned from you to make improvements to the site.Now, I’m going to ask you to read and sign this waiver that says it’s okay for us to make the recordings and that you understand what we can use those recordings for. Do you have any questions before we begin?</p>
