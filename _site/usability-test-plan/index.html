<h2>Write a Usability Test Plan</h2>
<div id="method-meta">
<p class="method-updated">18 January 2013</p></div>
<p class="method-description">When a product is "usable" it helps a person to do something with as little fuss or frustration as possible. One way to check that a product is usable is to observe a person as they use the product while describing what they're doing and why - thinking aloud. After the test you can then make changes to your product to iron out anything that caused problems for the tester. This is a usability test. Usability testing requires some planning, so in this method I describe the steps that I go to write a usability test plan document.</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Define the broad purpose of your test.

<blockquote><p>Example: The purpose of this test is to identify improvements that need to be made to the checkout flow. We will address these in our next sprint.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>State the people you'll ask to carry out the test and where you'll find them.

<blockquote><p>We will test the site with representative users; young women living in Dublin who need to plan foreign travel and who might want to purchase excursions, travel insurance, travel guides, maps, and related items. These users will be recruited by an outside agency.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Set a number of measurable goals for your test.

<blockquote><p>Our goal is to test the checkout flow of the site with between 3 and 5 users producing a set of observations, answers and metrics that can be circulated to the design team before Friday.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Describe the method you'll use for the test.

<blockquote><p>We will carry out an assessment-style usability test. Users will be invited to come to our office. They will sit at a computer where the prototype of the site will be open in a browser. A moderator will <a href="/start-usability-test">introduce the test</a>. The moderator will describe a task to the user who will attempt to complete it. The moderator will ask clarifying questions while the user is completing the task if necessary. The moderator will ask a set of questions after each task has been completed or abandoned. The user will answer each question on a scale of 1-5. The moderator will then introduce the next task. After the test the user will be asked to complete a post-test questionnaire.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Describe how data will be collected during the test.

<blockquote><p>The screen will be recorded as the user carries out tasks. the user's face and voice will be recorded using the laptop's built-in camera. A backup audio recording will be made using a digital audio recorder. The moderator will make hand-written notes during the test. The user's answers and to post-task questions will be noted on a pre-made, printed template.</p></blockquote></li>
<li>Describe how the data will be analyzed after the test.</li>
<li>Describe how you'll report the findings of the test to other members of the team and interested parties.</li>
<li>List the tasks the user will be asked to complete during the test. Usually this is included as an attached but separate <a href="/usability-test-script">test script</a>.</li>
</ul>
