<h2>Round a Buoy in a Triathlon</h2>
<div id="method-meta">
<p class="method-updated">19 January 2013</p></div>
<p class="method-description">During the swim phase of a triathlon you will usually have to go around a number of buoys that mark out the swim course. In this method I describe the most comfortable way to round a buoy while maintaining momentum.</p>
<h3>The Wrong Way</h3>

<p>The temptation when swimming around buoy is to swim a wide course around the buoy so that you never have to make a sharp turn. This wastes time and energy. Another approach is to swim directly at the buoy and then use brute strength to push your body in the right direction. This approach will usually mean coming to a dead stop. When lots of people do this the turn becomes like a traffic jam.</p>

<h3>The Right Way</h3>

<p>Another, more elegant approach to rounding a buoy will save you time and energy. In this approach you will roll around the buoy once or twice trimming your course while maintaining momentum. The approach is demonstrated in this video by <a href="http://swimtech.co.uk">SwimTech UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you're taking a left turn, swim into the buoy keeping the buoy on your left side.</li>
<li>Your left arm should enter the water at or just past the buoy.</li>
<li>You will be on your left side as you complete this stroke with your left arm. Your right arm will already be starting to come up to take a stroke.</li>
<li>Instead of rolling back onto your right side, continue to roll left.</li>
<li>As you roll left your right arm should come back over your right shoulder. At this point you will be swimming on your back.</li>
<li>Catch the water with your right arm using it to give you leverage to complete the roll.</li>
<li>Take a stroke with your left arm and continue swimming normally.</li>
<li>You should now be swimming on a course roughly 45&deg; to the left.</li>
<li>You can roll again if you need to take a sharper turn.</li>
</ul>
